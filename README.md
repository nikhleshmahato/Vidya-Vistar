## 🎯 Problem Statement

<p>In today’s fast-paced tech world, learners are confused — <strong>"Where do I begin?"</strong> Platforms are cluttered, overwhelming, and unstructured. That’s where <strong>Vidya Vistar</strong> steps in.</p>

## 🔧 Our Solution: A 3-Part Ecosystem

<p><strong>According to the EdTech hackathon theme</strong>, we built a minimal, working solution that blends productivity tools from different platforms into one learner-first experience:</p>

### 1️⃣ Roadmap Generator 🎓
- Users input goals like “Become a React Developer”
- Auto-generated roadmaps with tutorials, YouTube links & quizzes
- Structured learning, no guesswork

### 2️⃣ Resource Hub 🌐
- Inspired by community tags like <code>#trends</code> on Twitter
- Public feedback helps highlight important tech resources
- Curated videos licensed and rated by our learners — <em>not algorithms</em>
- No like/share distractions — we use honest, learner-based ranking

### 3️⃣ Test & Mentor System 📜
- Learners take community tests every 6–8 months
- Certified learners can apply as mentors for the next batch
- True learning, peer growth, and recognition



## 💡 What Makes Us Different?

<p><strong>We didn’t build just another app — we built a learning culture.</strong></p>

- No forced video calls 🎥 — if a learner isn’t interested, the credits speak for themselves.
- Community over control — content grows with feedback 🌱
- Minimal tech stack = faster deployment, easier debugging 🛠️
- Learning + Contribution = Leadership
